A floating islands world generator plugin for Bukkit/Spigot/Paper 1.15.2.
It is quite slow, since it must sample noise for many blocks in each chunk. There is no way to greatly improve performance other than completely changing how islands are generated.

# Features
- Ore generation
- Default Minecraft decorators
- Some biomes
- Generates debris on islands that are covered by other islands

# Features that may someday be added
- Biome generation using Voronoi tessellation, which would allow a much greater variety of biomes
- Larger bodies of water
- Structures to shake things up a bit
